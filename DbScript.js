    "Full-News":"ValueMomentum, Inc., one of the largest standalone providers of software and services to North American insurers, announced today that its Insurance IT Services and capabilities have been profiled in a new report from Celent. Published in August, 2017, the Celent IT Services Vendors report is focused on IT Service providers for insurers. A total of 24 vendors were profiled across 15 categories with ValueMomentum being one of only four vendors recognized in all categories..The report is Celent’s third profiling IT service vendors for the insurance industry and notes that the IT services market is recalibrating, impacting services providers’ opportunities and value propositions. Multiple trends and forces are creating changes in the categories of IT services, including digital business imperatives, cloud, intelligent automation, and business solutions.According to Karen Monks of Celent, analyst and author of the report, “In Celent’s view, the most successful partnerships insurers have with IT service vendors are the ones that are not just about replacing staff or lowering costs. The best partnerships are those that are long-term, strategic engagements, where a vendor is leveraged to bring in new expertise, adds both technology and domain knowledge to the business, and is relied on as a true partner.”“We couldn’t agree more with Celent when it comes to what makes for the best partnerships between insurers and vendors,” stated Jim Carlucci, vice president of insurance with ValueMomentum. “Our value proposition is based more on delivering and enabling new value for our insurer clients more so than just operational cost savings. Our approach and value message is resonating well with the market and is validated by our strong momentum and growing client base among insurance entities of all sizes since the last edition of this Celent report.”Celent’s Monks concluded, “In the market for IT services, ValueMomentum is one of several profiled vendors that is ready to meet the needs of insurers as a partner in tackling digital business imperatives, cloud, intelligent automation, and business process improvements.”"})
