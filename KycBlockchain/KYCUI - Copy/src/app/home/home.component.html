  What is BlockChain?
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-10">
      <p>      Blockchain is a transformational technology with the potential 
      to extend digital transformation beyond a companyâ€™s walls and 
      into the processes it shares with suppliers, customers and partners. 
      At its core, a blockchain is a data structure that is used to create 
      a digital transaction ledger that, instead of resting with a single provider, 
      is shared among a distributed network of computers.

  How BlockChain works?
 </h4>
 <div class=" row subtext">
   <p class="col-md-6">
      An essential feature of blockchain is its ability to encrypt each "block" 
      of data for a unique hash output that is also stamped onto the succeeding block, 
      creating a chain of sequential information which is then verified through a consensus
       of activity across a network of participants. This works in 
      conjunction with digital signatures to prove identity, authenticity 
      and enforce data access rights.
